# MyWebsite
I'm building a website using GoLang. I'm a begginer and 5 years ago I tried to learn python and Javascript. I feel like for the last 5 years I've been sort of in a tutorial hell. 
I tried to build a Card Game in Swift and that was probably the most I've learned about developing a software. This time I'm trying something that I think is harder and It's a little scary TBH.
I'm just going with it. I appreciate any support.


Tentative Name.... "Speak". Right now I hope to develop an image board.
